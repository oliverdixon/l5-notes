# OWD's University of York Mathematics Notes

This repository contains my personal collection of LaTeX-typeset notes based on
the Mathematics curriculum at the University of York. If you're looking for the
compiled PDFs, go straight to <https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~od641/l5-notes>. If
you're looking for my Level 4 examination crib sheets (which are no longer
permitted in centrally timetabled exams), head over to
<https://github.com/oliverdixon/exam-crib-sheets>.

## Module Index

 * Level 5: Metric Spaces [*In progress*]
 * Level 5: Linear Algebra [*Scheduled for Semester 2*]
 * Level 5: Groups, Rings, and Fields [*Scheduled for Semester 2*]

Contact me at <od641@york.ac.uk> if you spot any errors or have comments
regarding these notes. Please be mindful that I am reading the [MMath Mathematics and Computer Science (with a year in industry)](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/mmath-mathematics-computer-science-year-industry/)
degree, and therefore do not study approximately half of the modules considered
"core" by the Mathematics Department.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to any or all of these notes, please feel free
to (a) send a patch to <od641@york.ac.uk>, or (b) fork the GitHub repository,
make the necessary changes in your own copy, and submit a pull request. Either
way, you'll need to locally compile the LaTeX with a single invocation of
`latexmk -pdf`. You'll also need to set-up a post-commit hook in the Git
repository to make version-control data visible to
[gitinfo2](https://ctan.org/pkg/gitinfo2) when rendering the front covers.
